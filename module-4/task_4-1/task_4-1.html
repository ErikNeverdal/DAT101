      <li>Why is object-oriented development so important in programming?</li>
      <p>Object-oriented development is important because it makes code easier to organize, reuse, maintain, and scale.</p>
      <li>In Task 1, we create a static object called "AccountType." Explain what this object is used for and
how this type of object can help us in software development.</li>
      <p>The "AccountType" object is used to define and categorize different types of bank accounts. By using a static object for this purpose, we can easily manage and reference the various account types throughout our code. This approach promotes consistency and reduces the likelihood of errors, as we can rely on a single source of truth for account type definitions.</p>
      <li>Discuss why we use encapsulation in classes. Why do we want to "hide" code within our class?
Explain how we can create "private" and "public" members in a constructor function.</li>
      <p>Encapsulation is used in classes to restrict access to certain components of an object and protect the internal state from unintended interference. By hiding code within a class, we can expose only the necessary parts of the object through a public interface, promoting modularity and reducing complexity. In a constructor function, we can create "private" members by using closures or by prefixing member names with a hash (#) symbol (in modern JavaScript). Public members can be defined normally and are accessible from outside the class.</p>
      <li>Explain what happens when we use the "new" command in JavaScript.</li>
      <p>When we use the "new" command in JavaScript, it creates a new instance of an object. This process involves several steps: a new empty object is created, the constructor function is called with the new object as its context (this), and the new object is returned. If the constructor function does not explicitly return an object, the newly created object is returned by default.</p>
