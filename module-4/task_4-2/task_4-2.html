      <li>What is an array? A short and concise answer is expected here!</li>
      <p>An array is a data structure that stores multiple values of the same type in a single variable, accessed by index.</p>
      <li>What does it mean to "hardcode" when we talk about programming? (In English, it's called "hard
coding", "hard-coding", or "hardcoding").</li>
      <p>Hardcoding refers to the practice of embedding fixed values directly into the source code, rather than obtaining them from external sources or user input.</p>
      <li>Explain in plain text what happens in task 3, and how we can traverse (iterate) the array when we
(humans) don't "know" how long the array is.</li>
      <p>In task 3, we take a string and split it into an array of words. To traverse the array without knowing its length, we can use a loop that continues until it reaches the end of the array.</p>
      <li>Why is it beneficial to store instances of a class in arrays, as in task 4?</li>
      <p>Storing instances of a class in arrays allows for organized management of related objects, enabling easy iteration, access, and manipulation of the objects as a group.</p>
      <li>Try your best to explain the EWeekDays object from task 7. How do we use the "value" attribute, for
example? In what way do "WeekDay", "Workdays", and "Weekends" differ from each other? If we
wanted to create a new element "WorkoutDays", which would contain "Monday", "Wednesday", and
"Thursday", how would it ideally look? (I will choose the best answer to this task and reward it with
pizza in the cafeteria right after New Year. Remember to mark in your submission if you want to
participate in the competition!)</li>
      <p>We use the "value" attribute to represent the bitwise value of each day. "WeekDay" refers to individual days, while "Workdays" and "Weekends" are combinations of these days. To create "WorkoutDays", we could define it as follows:</p>
      <li>In task 8, we will use a "callback" routine when sorting. Explain how such a "callback" routine works.</li>
      <p>A "callback" routine is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed after some kind of event or condition is met. In the context of sorting, a callback function can be used to define the sorting criteria, allowing for custom sorting behavior.</p>
      <li>What happens in the sorting routines you have created? Try to explain how the array can figure out
if an element should come before or after another. The best way to answer this is to actually print
both parameters each time the sorting routine runs.</li>
      <p>In the sorting routines, the array compares elements using the callback function. By printing both parameters, we can see the values being compared and understand the sorting logic.</p>
      <li>In task 10, we will create an array with rows and columns. Explain what the first element of the array contains.</li>
      <p>The first element of the array contains the first row of the 2D array, which is itself an array representing the columns in that row.</p>
