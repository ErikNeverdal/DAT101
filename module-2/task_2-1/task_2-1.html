<!--
Part 1: In HTML, JavaScript code is inserted between <script> and </script> tags.

Part 2: Let, const and var are used to declare variables in JavaScript.

Part 3: let x = 7;
let y = 6;
let z = x + y;
let valuePI = 3.14;
const mittmorsnavn = Wenche;
let alderwenche = 50;
let string = "Ronaldo is the GOAT";
let integer = 983476938476394867;
let float = 31415926.53589793238;
const cr7 = x + y + z;

Part 4: If you use any virable, the error goes away. If you dont the error the error stays.

Part 5: What happened was that the value of Z changed from 13 to 60.

Discussion questions:
1. Can we create variables and constants without assigning values to them? If not, why, and which
ones (variables, constants, or both)?
No, we cant create variables and constants without assigning values to them. Because they need a value to be defined.

2. Can we create variables and constants on the same line, or must we separate them onto different
lines? If we can, how do we differentiate them?
Yes, we can create variables and constants on the same line. We differentiate them by using let for variables and const for constants.
for example: let x = 7, y = 53; const z = x + y;

3. Can we assign a new value to a constant later in the code? Try to explain why we can or cannot.
No, we cannot assign a new value to a constant later in the code. Because constants are meant to not be changed, meaning they cannot be changed.

4. What happens if we create a variable without using the let or const commands? Now, add "use
strict" to the very top of your script. Describe what you observe in the browser's "Inspect"
window. You can learn more about "use strict" on W3Schools.
If we create a variable without using the let or const commands. In the browser's "Inspect" window, we would see an error message showing that the variable is not defined.

5. What are implicit and explicit variable declarations?
Implicit variable declarations are when we create a variable without using the let or const commands. Explicit variable declarations are when we create a variable using the let or const commands.
